# Plant-Disease-Detection-using-VGG16
This repository contains a deep learning project for plant disease detection using the VGG16 model.

🌿 Objective: The primary goal of this project is to detect plant diseases using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

🌱 Importance: Early and accurate disease diagnosis can significantly impact crop yields, making this project essential for agriculture.

🧠 Model: Our project harnesses the power of the VGG16 deep learning architecture, a proven model for image classification tasks.

📦 Dataset: We rely on the extensive New Plant Diseases Dataset, which provides a diverse collection of plant images for training and validation. You can find this dataset at this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset/data.

📊 Accuracy: While we have achieved notable accuracy on the test dataset, it's important to note that this is just the beginning.

🔍 Continuous Improvement: We believe that accuracy can be further increased through strategies such as:

- More Epochs: Extending the training duration can enhance the model's ability to learn intricate patterns in plant images.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: Careful optimization of hyperparameters, such as learning rates and batch sizes, can lead to improved performance.

- Data Augmentation: Increasing data diversity through techniques like data augmentation can enhance the model's ability to generalize.

- Advanced Architectures: Exploring more advanced deep learning architectures can unlock even higher accuracy.

🔍 Usage: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
